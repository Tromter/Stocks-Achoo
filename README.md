# Achoo
This is an adaptation of tmthyjames' Achoo project. It is adapted to take various news/relevant inputs from the internet and predict whether shares of a stock should be bought or sold on that day. May be considered as a simple 'in or out of the market' problem in the beginning to simplify the problem.

Achoo uses a Raspberry Pi to predict if my son will need his inhaler on any given day using weather, pollen, and air quality data. If the prediction for a given day is above a specified threshold, the Pi will email his school nurse, and myself, notifying her that he may need preemptive treatment. **TUTORIAL COMING SOON**

Prompted by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/70udwq/what_routine_tasks_do_you_automate_with_programs/) reddit post. Lots of great ideas in there.

**UPDATE: 09/27/2017**

My goal is to have this repo completely decoupled from any UI and instead act as a restful-like API that could be consumed by any UI. Achoo's default UI is housed [here](https://github.com/tmthyjames/AchooUI).

**UPDATE**

I will be updating this readme fairly often for the next week or two to make sure the code and instructions are as readable as possible.

## Environment setup

First, you'll want to declare a few environment variables:

`ACHOO_FROM_EMAIL` - the sender's email address.<br/>
`ACHOO_TO_EMAIL` - the email addresses to send the alerts to.<br/>
`ACHOO_GMAIL_PASSWORD` - to send emails (if you don't already have one) you'll need to register an app with gmail.<br/>
`ACHOO_DARK_SKY_API_KEY` - for the weather data, I'm using [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev). You get 1,000 free hits a day. Their pricing is really affordable.<br/>
`ACHOO_DARK_SKY_LOCATION` - The latitude, longitude for the location you'll be tracking. <br/>
`ACHOO_POLLEN_ZIPCODE` - The zipcode you'll be tracking.<br/>
`ACHOO_DB_USERNAME` - the PostgreSQL username (or other database).<br/>
`ACHOO_DB_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL password.<br/>
`ACHOO_DB_DATABASE` - Name of the database (default: `achoo`).<br/>
`ACHOO_DB_PORT` - Port number (default: `5432`).<br/>

## Achoo workflow

For now, the work flow is reflected in the bash script that runs daily:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

Rscript app/models/exe/r/train_model.r &&

python app/munging/get_allergy_data.py &&
python app/munging/get_weather_data.py &&
python app/munging/get_air_data.py &&

Rscript app/models/exe/r/run_model.r &&

python app/munging/get_results.py
```

1) Train the model (this assumes we have data, so I'll upload some test data that I've been using)
2) Get all weather, allergy, and air quality data
3) Run the model (this will write the results to the database after every run)
4) Retrieve the results (this is the step that sends the email if the prediction is greater than X).

This bash script currently runs as a cron job.

**THIS IS LIKELY TO CHANGE SOON.**

To record the inhaler/breathing treatment data, you'll run `treatment_tracker.py` from your Raspberry Pi like this:

```bash
$ python treatment_tracker.py &
```

I have two buttons on my Pi: one for his breathing treatment, the other for his inhaler (pics and a blog post coming soon).

### Outstanding questions

1) Is there a better way than using a cron job?<br/>
2) The Raspberry Pi isn't ideal. Maybe we should be using [Nomie 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nomie-2/id1190618299?mt=8) to record events? (HT to [sujins](https://www.reddit.com/user/sujins) for this suggestion). I'd like to make it easy for the user to add their own method and their own host for storing data.<br/>
3) I have a feeling many users will want to easily add their own models (Nueral Networks, GBMs, GLMs, etc.). What is the best way for users to add their own models?<br/>
4) Should we support two languages? Currently I'm using Python and R.<br/>
5) I still have a lot of architectural concerns about this project so far, but I'm hoping things will be more smooth as a couple weeks' worth of development pass.<br/>
6) **LONG TERM**: How to make this non-developer friendly? How can the typical person with allergies/asthma make use of this day-to-day? Can we make this a mobile app? I think this is my end goal.<br/>

### Here's my Pi setup

Blue button is for inhaler (first line of defense)

red button is for breathing treatment (second line of defense; use this one if his symptoms are really bad)
